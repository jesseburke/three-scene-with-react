LabelMakers, of which there is one now, called htmlLabelMaker, take
as arguments: labelContainerDiv, initCoordFunc, width, height, where
initCoordFunc is a function that....

LabelMakers should return an
object of the form {addLabel, removeLabel, removeAllLabels,
drawLabels, changeCoordFunc}, where addLabel expects an object of form
{pos, text, style, anchor} and returns a string. removeLabel expects a
string that was returned from addLabel, and removes the label that was
added.

What does changeCoordFunc do?

[How does the remove function remove the corresponding div from labelContainerDiv?]

What future LabelMakers could there be?
