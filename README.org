Small personal library I use to write [[https://threejs.org][Three.js]] scenes, declaratively, using
[[https://reactjs.org][React]] and the atomic state managment library [[https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai][jotai]].

A small example app is
[[https://jesseburke.org/apps/three-scene-with-react-example/]]. 

* How does it work?
  
  ThreeSceneComp is a React component, whose underlying html element is the
  canvas that Three renders into. For instance, the example app has
  the form:
  #+begin_src javascript
   <div>
      <main>
	  <ThreeSceneComp>
	      <Axes3D />
	      <Grid/>
	      <FunctionGraph3D/>
	      <CameraControls />
	  </ThreeSceneComp>
	  <CameraInputComp />
      </main>
  </div>
  #+end_src

  ThreeSceneComp sets up the basics needed to render a ThreeJS scene,
  including a camera, renderer, etc. They are stored in a function
  closure that is accessible to all children of ThreeSceneComp under
  the object useThreeCBs.

  Components have a lot of flexibility in how they respond to changes
  in the data. For instance, if a certain mesh with a very complicated
  geometry takes color as a prop, the component can be written to keep
  the geometry and only the change the material of the mesh, when the
  color prop changes.
  
* Other features

** Camera debug

   Shows second screen, with second camera, that lets user observe the
   first camera's position in relation to the scene; see the example
   app.

** Photos

** Labels

** Mouse picking

** Controls interactions
